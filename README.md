HadoopExperiment
================

My experiments with Hadoop and MapReduce.

<h3 id="overview">Overview of the Files</h3>

* HadoopExperiment - Contains the Java project.
* input.zip - Contains sample inputs from Project Gutenberg.

<h3 id="commands">How to Run the Project</h3>

The following command will run Hadoop (assuming Hadoop is installed):

		hadoop jar <jar-file-location> <driver-class-location> <input-directory-location> <output-directory-location>

Also, a handy hadoop.sh script is here for ease-of-use (instead of the long string above):

		bash hadoop.sh
