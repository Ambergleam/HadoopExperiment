HadoopExperiment
================

My experiments with Hadoop and MapReduce.

<h1 id="overview">An overview of the files:</h2>
HadoopExperiment - Contains the Java project.

input.zip - Contains sample inputs from Project Gutenberg.

<h1 id="commands">How to Run</h2>
The following command will run Hadoop (assuming Hadoop is installed):

> hadoop jar <jar-file-location> <driver-class-location> <input-directory-location> <output-directory-location>

Also, a handy hadoop.sh script is here for ease-of-use (instead of the long string above):

> bash hadoop.sh
